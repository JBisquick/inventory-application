# odin-inventory-application

This project creates a website used in a grocery shop to manage its online stock.

# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** NodeJS, Express, PUG, and Mongoose

Routes, views, controllers, and models were used by me to construct the website and database. I also used an online Atlas Mongoose database to store the data.

# Lesson's Learned:

This project further honed my understanding of how the different components of a backend work together to create a fully functional website. It was my first time building my own fully functional backend without following a tutorial.
